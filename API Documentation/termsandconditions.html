                                    Any orders without a valid email address will not be eligible to receive  products, and therefore your Order will not be processed.<br />
                                    When you place your Order, we will issue you with a Web Order Number. We will do this via the Decibel Web Site, unless you have placed your Order by telephone, in which case we will issue your Web Order Number when you telephone us.

In such circumstances we will contact you to inform you and may suggest alternative Products that you might wish to purchase. If you do not accept our suggestions then we will cancel your Order in relation to those Products we cannot supply and repay you any money that you may have paid to us in respect of those Products.
